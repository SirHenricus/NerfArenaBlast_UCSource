This is the UnrealScript source code for the game Nerf Arena Blast (1999). The game runs on Unreal Engine 1. I have exported the .uc files from the .u package files using NerfEd (The games built-in editor based on UnrealEd).

I'm only uploading the source code here just because I'm curious about how the game works and I don't really plan on using it for anything else. I just like staring at bunches of code. Maybe someone else can find a use for it, but I wouldn't know.

None of the code has been modified after it was exported from NerfEd.
